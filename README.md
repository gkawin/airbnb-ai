# Leveraging Data to Enforce Short-Term Rental Rules

## Introduction:
In response to Vancouver's housing affordability crisis, regulations now require Airbnb hosts to live on the property they rent out. To enforce these rules, we are developing a data-driven approach using Airbnb data.


## Setup

Create virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
* On Windows:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
* On macOS and Linux:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install new package if needed:

```
pip install {package_name}
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Deactivate the virtual environment:
```
deactivate
```

Don't forget to activate the virtual environment every time you enter the project again.

## How to get data

1. Activate the virtual environment as described above
2. Move to the folder with scraping files and run downloading of listing htmls and their jsons:
```
cd src/data_loading/
python download_listing_jsons.py
```
3. Parse downloaded listing jsons to get listing description, amenities and house rules in .jsonl file:
```
python parse_listings_info.py
```


## (optional) How to dump listing information 

1. Activate the virtual environment as described above

2. Add `.env` file to the root directory and insert your RapidAPI key there RAPIDAPI_KEY="your key". Should look like `.env_example` file

3. Move to the folder with dumping file and run the file:
```
cd src/data_loading/
python dump_listings_with_rapidapi.py 
```

## To run tests

1. Activate the virtual environment as described above

3. Move to the folder with tests and run pytest:
```
cd src/tests/
pytest -v
```
